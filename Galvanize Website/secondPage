                <p>Hey everybody! I'm sure you have all been just as excited as I have.
                    I'm Nick, I'm 32. I have a little girl (almost 3 years old already!) and two kitties.
                </p>

                <h2>A quick peek at Nick!</h2>
                <h5 id="centertext"><strong>A little bit of everything</strong></h5>
                <p>I'm am a military brat. My pops was in the Air Force (Lt. Col) so I moved quite a bit. I've lived in most parts of the united states,
                    but I did most of growing up in Las Vegas, NV. I've recently just completed my CS Associates at Front Range Community college. It was 
                    a great experience. I did the two year program in three years (My daughter was born in the middle of that... o.O") while having a full
                    time job at Natural Grocers in Boulder. After a new baby, work, and school... I'm looking forward to "just" Galvanize. (Ask me what was harder in six months! haha)
              </p>               
                <h5 id="centertext"><strong>Wait, parents have time for HOBBIES?!</strong></h5>
                <p>
                    I try my best to have as much fun as I work, which is not easy. Besides the obvious Dad stuff I do with my daughter,
                    I also enjoy skateboarding, I try to get a few miles in everyday. I really enjoy watching hockey and football, Vegas Golden Knights 
                    and the Broncos. I'm a pretty avid video gamer. I have a very small streaming channel that I am trying to grow. All of this of course happens
                    pretty rarely, but i do try to squeeze it in!

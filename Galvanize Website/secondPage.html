                <h1>Where am I going?</h1>
                <h5><strong>THIS IS NOT MY LARGE AUTOMOBILE!</strong></h5>
                <p>I have always been a planner. It has helped me quite a bit. I plan my day. I try as much as possible to plan my week.
                    Anything more than that becomes detrimental. Being a father has taught me to throw plans out the window at the drop of a hat! It's
                    actually a little refreshing to learn to go with the flow. That all being said, I have NO idea where I'm going, but I do have some goals:
                    
                    Complete Galvanize.
                    Provide the life for my daughter that I was given, if not better.
                    
                    Anything that past either of those goals is a bonus. If you would of told me three years ago where I'd be, I would of laughed at you. 
                    I'm so proud of how far I have come, how far I will go, but right now I focus on what's in front me.
                </p>
                
                <h1>The Cohort and I</h1>
                <p> At the time of writing this, I have not personally met any of you. I can however tell you, that all of you right now mean a lot to me.
                We are all about to go through this together, and I'm already there for you. We all need people to help us, and I want you all to know if there 
                is anything I can do to help you, just ask. </p>
